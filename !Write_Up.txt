
As of the last edit made to the source code (04 Nov 2014 @ 10:53), my
assignment works most of the time it's run.  There are two known errors
and they are outline below.

Bug 1
======
Occasionally, the signature verification will detect a signature
mismatch.  This mismatch will propagate to the end of the program possibly
causing the incorrect message to be displayed at the end. Because the nonce
is only one digit in size, there is a chance the value display is actually
the correct answer because the nonce space is so small.

My guess is that this is due to an overflow in the program when encrypting
the message (session key + nonce) with Alice's private key creating a
number that overflows.

Bug 2
======
This bug is far more rare, but sometimes a BadPaddingException is thrown
by the Alice thread when decrypting the AES encrypted message.  The error
states the final block is not padded properly.  Consequently, the Final
Result of the program errors well with a NullPointerException.

If the program is run again, chances a good these errors will not reappear.
