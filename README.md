# CSS 527 : "RSA Threads"
Written as a assignment for CSS 527: Cryptography at the University of Washington | Bothell.

# Premise
The purpose of this assignment was to recrated the RSA key exchange between to entities: Alice and Bob.  This could be performed using a number of different methods such as a common text file written to the local directory, with two systems across a local network, and so on.  My proposed approach -- using threads, one for each actor, to mimic the RSA key exchange between two hosts -- was approved by the course instructor.
